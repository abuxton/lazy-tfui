---------

A Terminal User Interface (TUI) application written in `go` based on various sources and borrowing from k9s to provide a terminal application for Terraform Enterprise and Cloud (TFE || TFC).

This is not a replacement for Terraform client, it is a terminal ui for the Terraform Cloud API <https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs/api-docs>
